# FPGA-SVGA-Controller

This project implements an SVGA (Super VGA) controller on an FPGA using VHDL. The controller generates video signals for an 800x600 resolution display and supports various color patterns selectable via input switches.

## Features

- SVGA output (800x600 resolution)
- Configurable color patterns using input switches
- Implements both horizontal and vertical sync signals
- Uses a clock wizard for precise timing

## Hardware Requirements

- FPGA board (compatible with the used clock wizard)
- SVGA-compatible display
- Switches for pattern selection

## File Structure

- `svga.vhd`: Main VHDL file containing the SVGA controller implementation
- `clk_wiz_0.vhd`: Clock wizard component (not included in this repository)

## Usage

1. Synthesize the VHDL code for your target FPGA.
2. Connect your FPGA board to an SVGA-compatible display.
3. Use the input switches to select different color patterns:
   - 00: Magenta color
   - 01: Horizontal gradient
   - 10: Vertical gradient
   - 11: XOR pattern

## Implementation Details

- The controller uses a 25.175 MHz pixel clock (generated by the clock wizard).
- Horizontal sync pulse is 128 pixels wide.
- Vertical sync pulse is 4 lines tall.
- The active display area is from pixel 216 to 1015 horizontally and from line 23 to 622 vertically.
